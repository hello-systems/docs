description: "Add approval gates and review steps to keep humans in control of critical actions."
---

## When to Add

- **High-stakes actions** — Sending emails, making purchases, deleting data
- **Quality gates** — Reviewing AI-generated content
- **Compliance** — Audit trails, approval chains
- **Edge cases** — Exceptions automation can't decide

## Confirmation Types

### Simple approval

```
[user-input] Approve sending these 50 emails?
Options: Approve All, Reject All
```

### Review and edit

```
[user-input] Review the email draft:
- Show the draft
- Allow editing subject and body
- Approve or reject
```

### Selective approval

```
[user-input] Review each lead:
- Show details
- Approve or reject individually
```

### Data entry

```
[user-input] Enter discount for this customer:
- Customer history
- Discount % (0-50)
- Justification
```

## Example: Content Approval

**Step 1** — Generate:

```
Use @OpenAI to write a blog post on the topic
```

**Step 2** — Review:

```
[user-input] Review the draft:
- Read the content
- Edit for style/tone
- Approve, request changes, or reject
```

**Step 3** — Route:

```
If approved, continue
If rejected, end workflow
```

**Step 4** — Publish:

```
Publish to @WordPress
```

## Tips

1. **Provide context** — Show what action happens, who's affected, why approval needed
2. **Make decisions easy** — Clear options, clear consequences
3. **Keep forms simple** — Only ask what's needed
