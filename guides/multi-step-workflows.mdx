title: "Multi-Step Workflows"
description: "Break complex automations into steps. Each step does one thing. Data flows automatically between them."

## Why Steps?

- **Modularity** — Each step does one thing well
- **Debugging** — See exactly where issues occur
- **Readability** — Understand the workflow at a glance

## Example: Lead Qualification

**Step 1** — Fetch leads:

```
Get new leads from @HubSpot created in the last 24 hours
```

**Step 2** — Enrich:

```
For each lead, get company info from @Apollo
```

**Step 3** — Score:

```
Score each lead:
- Company size (1-10)
- Industry match (1-10)
- Title seniority (1-10)
```

**Step 4** — Route hot leads:

```
If score > 25:
- Add to "Hot Leads" in @HubSpot
- Alert #sales on @Slack
```

**Step 5** — Nurture the rest:

```
If score <= 25:
- Add to nurture sequence
- Tag as "nurture"
```

## Data Flow

Each step automatically accesses outputs from previous steps:

```
Using the leads from Step 1...
Take the enriched data from the previous step...
Filter the scored leads from Step 3...
```

<Info>Script wires up the data flow automatically.</Info>

## Conditional Logic

### If/then

```
If score > 25, add to hot leads
Otherwise, add to nurture
```

### Early exit

```
If no leads found, skip remaining steps
```

### Loops

```
For each lead:
- Enrich
- Score
- Update CRM
```

## Error Handling

### Per-step

```
If enrichment fails, log error and continue with next lead
```

### Workflow-level

```
If critical step fails, alert #ops and stop
```

### Retry

```
If API fails, retry 3 times with backoff
```

## Tips

1. **One thing per step** — "Fetch leads" not "Fetch, enrich, score, update"
2. **Validate early** — Check required fields before processing
3. **Plan for failure** — What happens if a step fails?

## Advanced

### Parallel processing

```
Process leads 1-50 and 51-100 in parallel
Combine when done
```

### Checkpointing

```
Save progress every 100 items
Resume from checkpoint if interrupted
```
