  <Step title="Sign in with Google" />
  <Step title="Grant access to your spreadsheets" />
</Steps>

## Reading Data

| Task | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Get all rows | `Get all rows from @Google Sheets "Sales Data"` |
| Specific tab | `Get rows from @Google Sheets "Sales Data" sheet "Q4 2024"` |
| Specific columns | `Get columns A, B, E from @Google Sheets "Leads"` |
| Filter rows | `Get rows from @Google Sheets "Leads" where Status = "New"` |
| By spreadsheet ID | `Get rows from @Google Sheets with ID "1BxiMVs..."` |

## Writing Data

| Task | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Add row | `Add row to @Google Sheets "Leads" with Name: John, Email: john@example.com` |
| Update row | `Update row in @Google Sheets "Leads" where Email = "john@example.com", set Status = "Contacted"` |
| Bulk write | `Write all results to @Google Sheets "Output"` |
| Create new | `Create @Google Sheets "Report - {{date}}" with summary data` |

## Common Patterns

### Import → Process → Export

```
Step 1: Get leads from @Google Sheets "Raw Leads"
Step 2: Enrich each lead with company data
Step 3: Write enriched data to @Google Sheets "Processed Leads"
```

### Sync Between Sheets

```
Step 1: Get new rows from Sheet A (since last sync)
Step 2: Transform to Sheet B format
Step 3: Append to Sheet B
Step 4: Mark as synced in Sheet A
```

### Report Generation

```
Step 1: Aggregate data from multiple sources
Step 2: Calculate summary statistics
Step 3: Write to @Google Sheets "Weekly Report"
```

## Working with Formulas

```
When updating, preserve columns F-H (they have formulas)
```

```
In column F, add formula: =VLOOKUP(A2, PriceList!A:B, 2, FALSE)
```

## Error Handling

```
If sheet doesn't exist, create it
If access denied, notify user
Process in batches of 500 rows (rate limits)
```

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max cells | 10 million per spreadsheet |
| Max rows | ~5 million |
| API calls/minute | 60 |
| API calls/day | 500,000 |

## Tips

1. **Use named ranges** instead of cell references for maintainability
2. **Validate before writing** — check required fields, formats
3. **Skip headers** when reading, include when creating
4. **Backup before bulk operations** — create a copy first
