## Components

- **Data enrichment** for personalization
- **AI-generated content** that sounds human
- **Multi-channel sequences** (email, LinkedIn)
- **Human oversight** for quality

## Basic Email Workflow

**Step 1** — Import:

```
Get leads from @Google Sheets where Status = "Not Contacted"
```

**Step 2** — Research:

```
For each lead:
- Get company info from @Apollo
- Find recent news via @Perplexity
- Identify pain points
```

**Step 3** — Write:

```
For each lead, write a personalized email:
- Reference something specific about their company
- Connect to a relevant pain point
- Under 100 words
- Clear CTA
```

**Step 4** — Review:

```
@form Review emails:
- Show recipient, subject, preview
- Allow editing
- Approve or reject each
```

**Step 5** — Send:

```
For approved emails:
- Send via @Gmail
- Log to spreadsheet
- Update status
```

## Multi-Touch Sequences

```
Day 0: Initial email
Day 3: Follow-up if no reply
Day 7: LinkedIn connection
Day 14: Final email, different angle
```
