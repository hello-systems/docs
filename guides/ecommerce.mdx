## Tips

1. **Test manually first** — Understand edge cases before automating
2. **Handle errors** — Retry failed emails, alert team if still failing
3. **Focus personalization** — Product recommendations > subject lines
4. **Track performance** — Open rates, recovery rates, time saved
5. **Respect preferences** — Honor unsubscribes, don't over-communicate
