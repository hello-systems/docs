## What is Script?

A platform for building backend workflows. Describe what you need in plain English, get TypeScript code that runs reliably at scale.

## Do I need to code?

No. Script generates all code from natural language. If you know TypeScript, you can view and edit it — but it's optional.

## How is this different from Zapier?

|               | Zapier               | Script                     |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Logic**     | Pre-built connectors | Generated code (any logic) |
| **Execution** | Per-operation fees   | Run code at fixed cost     |
| **Errors**    | Retry logic only     | Real error handling        |
| **Approvals** | Limited              | Built-in human-in-the-loop |

## How is this different from AI agents?

Script generates code **once**, then runs deterministically. Agents make AI decisions **every run**.

|               | Agents              | Script                     |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Behavior**  | Can vary            | Same inputs → same outputs |
| **Cost**      | Inference per run   | Code execution only        |
| **Debugging** | Hard (AI decisions) | Easy (it's just code)      |

## How accurate is generated code?

Most workflows work on first try. When refinements are needed, 1-3 follow-ups get you to production.

## What can Script connect to?

- 50+ built-in integrations
- Any REST API
- Databases (Supabase, PostgreSQL)
- AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## What outputs can I create?

- CSV, JSON files
- Dashboards and charts
- Human-in-the-loop forms
- Google Sheets
- Markdown reports

## Can I modify generated code?

Yes. Click any step to see and edit the TypeScript.

## Is my data secure?

- Code runs in isolated containers
- Credentials encrypted
- Data not retained beyond execution

## What if a step fails?

Error shows in logs. Update your description to handle the case, Script regenerates.

## Pricing?

See [script.so/pricing](https://script.so/pricing). One run = one workflow execution, regardless of step count.
