## Tools

| Tool | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Firecrawl** | General scraping, JS-heavy sites |
| **Apify** | Complex scenarios, pre-built scrapers |
| **HTTP requests** | Simple APIs, static pages |

## Basic Scraping

```
Use @Firecrawl to scrape https://example.com/products
```

## Extract Structured Data

```
Use @Firecrawl to scrape https://example.com/products and extract:
- Product name
- Price
- Description
- Image URL
```

## Crawl Multiple Pages

```
Use @Firecrawl to crawl all product pages on example.com
Start from /products
Limit to 100 pages
```

## Example: Price Monitoring

**Step 1** — Define targets:

```
Create a list of competitor product URLs to monitor
```

**Step 2** — Scrape prices:

```
Use @Firecrawl to scrape each URL and extract the current price
```

**Step 3** — Compare and alert:

```
Compare to our prices in @Google Sheets
If any competitor is 10%+ cheaper, alert @Slack
```

## Common Challenges

### JavaScript-rendered content

Firecrawl handles this automatically. For other methods:

```
Wait for the page to fully load before extracting
```

### Pagination

```
Follow the "Next" button until no more pages
```

### Rate limiting

```
Add 2-second delay between requests
```

### Authentication

```
Log in first, then scrape the dashboard
```

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Always check if scraping is permitted before proceeding.
</Warning>

1. **Respect robots.txt** — Check if scraping is allowed
2. **Rate limit** — Don't overwhelm servers
3. **Handle errors** — Sites change, pages disappear
4. **Check ToS** — Ensure scraping is permitted
5. **Mind privacy laws** — GDPR, CCPA for personal data
