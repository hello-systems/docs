## When to Use

- Process a list of leads
- Send personalized emails at scale
- Enrich multiple records
- Research many companies

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a workflow with input fields" />
  <Step title="Click Batch Run" />
  <Step title="Add your data (CSV, paste, or manual)" />
  <Step title="Click Submit — each row runs as a separate execution" />
</Steps>

## Example: Lead Outreach

**Step 1** — Define inputs:

```
[user-input] Enter:
- Lead name
- Lead email
- Company name
```

**Step 2** — Research:

```
Research the company using @Perplexity
```

**Step 3** — Generate email:

```
Write a personalized cold email referencing the research
```

**Step 4** — Send:

```
Send via @Gmail
```

Now upload a CSV with 500 leads and run them all.

## Adding Data

### Paste from spreadsheet

Copy cells from Excel or Google Sheets → paste directly into the table.

### Upload CSV

```csv
name,email,company
John Smith,john@acme.com,Acme Inc
Jane Doe,jane@techcorp.io,TechCorp
```

<Note>Column headers must match your input field names.</Note>

### Manual entry

Click **Add row** to enter data one by one.

## Monitor Progress

During execution:

- See status of each run (pending, running, completed, failed)
- View outputs as they complete
- Identify and retry failed runs

## Tips

1. **Test first** — Run on 1 item before batching hundreds
2. **Start small** — Try 5-10 rows, then scale up
3. **Check data** — Ensure required fields are filled
4. **Spot check** — Review a sample of outputs for quality
