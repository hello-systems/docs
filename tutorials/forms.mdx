## When to Use

- **Approval gates** — Review before sending emails or making changes
- **Data verification** — Confirm AI-generated content before it goes out
- **Manual input** — Collect information that can't be automated
- **Quality control** — Checkpoint critical workflows

## Basic Syntax

Add `@form` to any step description:

```
@form Review the email draft and approve before sending
```

The workflow pauses, shows a form, waits for input, then continues.

## Example: Email Approval

**Step 1** — Generate content:

```
Draft a follow-up email for leads who haven't responded in 7 days
```

**Step 2** — Get approval:

```
@form Review the draft and choose:
- Approve and send
- Edit the subject line
- Skip this lead
```

**Step 3** — Send:

```
If approved, send via @Gmail
```

## Form Fields

```
@form Collect the following:
- Confirm the recipient list (yes/no)
- Optionally edit the subject line
- Add notes for the recipient
```
